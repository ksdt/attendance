# attendance

Automatically generates an attendance grid for a given spinitron station.

To use, edit `index.js` and replace occurances of 'ksdt' with your own station ID. Then, run with `node index.js`.

You should have your spinpapi credentials in `process.env.SPIN_USER` and `process.env.SPIN_SECRET`. You can also set a port to listen on through `process.env.PORT`. The default port is 3000.

This works really well on Heroku's free tier.
